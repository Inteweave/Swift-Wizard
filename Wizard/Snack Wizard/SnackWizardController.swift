/// Sample wizard to enable the user to select a snack

/// - choose snack

/// This class is responsible for creating and showing view controllers
/// and for defining the screen navigation. For a real app the screen navigations would probably be
/// in its own file.
///
/// To add a screen, you would normally:
/// - code view controller, presenter and .xib
/// - add an identifier for the screen
/// - add the creation of the view controller to the factory
/// - add any new events raised by the screen
/// - add navigations for events going to the screen and handling the events from the screen
