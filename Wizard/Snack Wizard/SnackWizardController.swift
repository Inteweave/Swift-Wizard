/// To add a screen, you would normally:
/// - code the coordinator, view controller and .xib
/// - add an identifier for the screen
/// - add the creation of the coordinator to the factory
/// - add any new events raised by the screen
/// - add navigations for events going to the screen and handling the events from the screen
